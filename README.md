# Hobby_Recommender_Using_BERT
This project is a hobby recommender system that suggests places or activities based on the user's previous experiences and interests.
It leverages BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for natural language understanding and the Google Places API for real-world location data.

Key Features
Personalized Hobby Suggestions: Uses BERT to analyze user preferences and recommend locations that match their hobbies.
Real-time Data: Integrates with the Google Places API to provide up-to-date suggestions.
User Feedback Loop: Allows users to refine recommendations by providing feedback.

How It Works
Input: User provides details of hobbies and places they have visited.
Processing: BERT model processes the input to find similar places.
Output: The system returns recommended locations with relevant descriptions and directions.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
BERT: NLP model for semantic understanding.
Google Places API: To fetch location-based data.
Jupyter Notebook: For development and demonstration.
